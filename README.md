# TEM_KE_Daily

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the **Kuoâ€“Eliassen equation** in the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework, designed to calculate the daily secondary circulation and forcing contributions from ERA5 reanalysis data.

##  Overview

The core script `solve_TEM_KE_daily.m` solves the quasi-diagnostic Kuoâ€“Eliassen equation using zonally averaged heating, momentum, EP flux divergence, and G-vector divergence as forcings. The method handles daily resolution and layered vertical interpolation.

##  File Descriptions

##  Dependencies

- MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)
- Input variables: ERA5 daily data of `u`, `v`, `w`, `T`, and `theta` on pressure levels
- Preprocessing: Zonal averaging must be done beforehand

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Inputs**:
    - ERA5 variables (`u`, `v`, `w`, `T`, `theta`) with size `[lon x lat x level x day]`
    - Latitude, pressure, and coordinate maps

2. **Run the driver**:
    ```matlab
    main_TEM_driver
    ```

3. **Outputs**:
    - All forcings (e.g., `FJ`, `FF`, `FEPphi1`, `FGp2`, etc.)
    - Daily `FTEM` streamfunction: the sum of all forcing responses
    - Saved to NetCDF using `save_nc_block`

## ðŸ“¤ Output Variables

Each output variable has dimensions `[lat x lev x day]`, including:

- `FTEM`: Total streamfunction response
- `FJ`, `FF`: Diabatic heating & friction components
- `FEP*`, `FG*`: EP flux and G-vector components
- `tempsi`, `eumpsi`: Streamfunction from integrating v*
